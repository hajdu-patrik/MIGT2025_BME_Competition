## Overview

This document contains the solution developed for the **2025 Student Competition** organized by the Department of Artificial Intelligence and System Engineering. The competition's objective was to develop an **efficient, cooperative agent system** for simulating a modern **Urban Search and Rescue (USAR)** scenario.

## Competition Description

The competition task is a creative programming challenge related to the fields of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**, designed to be solvable even without deep prior knowledge of these subjects. Submitted solutions are evaluated by an **automatic scoring system**, and the ranking is determined based on the points achieved.

## Requirements and Recommended Knowledge

The use of any resources is permitted to solve the task. Experienced **Java** or **Python** programmers are at an advantage.

* **Core Requirements:** Programming proficiency, creativity, and knowledge of basic mathematical logical formalisms.
* **Recommended Prior Knowledge:**
    * Comprehensive understanding of the **Artificial Intelligence** course material (BME-MIT).
    * Familiarity with the topics covered in **Machine Learning**, **Formal Methods**, or **Intelligent Distributed Systems** courses.

The competition provides an excellent opportunity for those interested in efficient, algorithmic problem-solving in a computational environment.

## A Glimpse into the Competition Task

* **Scenario:** Urban Search and Rescue (USAR).
* **Challenge:** In the event of natural disasters, accidents, or conflict situations, rapid evacuation of an area and the search for survivors is critical. Modern robotic tools (drones, rescue robots) are deployed to assist in these efforts.
* **The Goal:** To create the most efficient program system (**agent logic**) for autonomous machines that:
    1.  Facilitates the quick execution of the rescue mission (locating and evacuating survivors).
    2.  Minimizes communication between the machines (number of message exchanges).
    3.  Optimizes resource utilization (energy, medicine) within a dedicated simulation environment.

## Competition Result Integration

Good results achieved in the competition will be taken into consideration by the department in the academic assessment of its AI-related subjects.

## Participation

I participated in this competition and developed the code found in this repository to solve the task. My solution is built upon the **"Hive Mind" strategy**, where the robots (**Drones, Rescue Robots, Medical Robots**) coordinate exploration and rescue efforts through a **shared knowledge base** to maximize overall efficiency.
